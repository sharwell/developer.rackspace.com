Quickstart for Cloud Files
==========================
Rackspace offers a flexible and scalable solution to object storage through its Cloud Files service.

The core storage system is designed to provide a secure, network-accessible way to store an unlimited number of files.
Files that exceed 5 GB in size are broken down into segments of 5 GB or less.
For example, if you need to store large files such as videos, HD movies, or
backups, Cloud Files accomplishes this by enabling you to upload multiple file segments
and a manifest file to map those segments together.
Large files are then downloaded as
a single file. You can store as much as you want and pay only for storage space that you
actually use.

Cloud Files also provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and distribute content
behind a content delivery network (CDN). As a Cloud Files user, you get access to this
network automatically.

Concepts
========
To use this service effectively, you should understand how these key ideas are used in this context:

CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    A network of high-availability servers delivering content to users. Cloud Files uses the Akamai CDN.

container
    A storage compartment that provides a way for you to organize your data.

object
    The basic storage entity in Cloud Files.
    An object represents a files and its optional metadata that you upload to the system.

Authenticate to gain access to the service
==========================================
To use this service you have to authenticate first. To do this, you will need your Rackspace username, and one of the following:

* your Rackspace account password
* your Rackspace API key

Your username and password are the ones you use to login to the Cloud Control Panel at http://mycloud.rackspace.com/.

To find your API key, first navigate to the Cloud Control Panel, then click on your username at the top right corner, and then finally click on Account Settings. You will be taken to a page that shows your settings. Under Login Details, you can show or reset your API key.

Once you have these pieces of information, you can pass them into the SDK:

.. include:: samples/authentication.rst

Use the API
===========
Some of the basic operations you can perform with this API are described below.

Create container
----------------
Before you can upload any objects to Cloud Files, you must create a container to receive the objects.
To create a container:

.. include:: samples/create_container.rst

CDN-enable container
--------------------
To make any objects within a container publicly readable,
enable the container for access on the CDN (Content Delivery Network):

.. include:: samples/set_container_as_cdn.rst

Disable CDN for container
-------------------------
If you no longer wish to have your objects publicly readable, disable CDN access for the container:

.. include:: samples/unset_container_as_cdn.rst

Delete container
----------------
To delete a container:

.. include:: samples/delete_container.rst

For data safety reasons, you may not delete a container until **all** objects within it have been deleted.

Upload objects to container
---------------------------
To upload objects into a container:

.. include:: samples/upload_object.rst

Change object metadata
------------------------
To change object metadata:

.. include:: samples/change_object_metadata.rst

Once you have an object uploaded to a container you can change its metadata in-place.
For instance, you can change its content-type so that when delivered to requesting clients it can be treated accordingly.

Get object
----------
You and your clients can retrieve objects from Cloud Files in several ways.
To retrieve objects, the most common ways are:

Get object via temporary URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To retrieve an object via temporary URL:

.. include:: samples/get_object_temp_url.rst

Get object via SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To download objects directly into your local storage drive via SDK download:

.. include:: samples/get_object_sdk.rst

Get object via CDN URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To retrieve an object through a CDN URL, that, unlike a temporary URL, never expires and may be considered a publicly-accessible permalink:

.. include:: samples/get_object_cdn.rst

Delete object
-------------
To delete an object from its container:

.. include:: samples/delete_object.rst
